      <p class="body">Beech is deciduous tree that belongs to the family Fagaceae. There are 11 species of beech that can be found in the northern parts of Europe, Asia and North America. Beech usually grows on chalk, limestone and other well-drained and fertile types of soil. Young plants can survive in partially shaded areas, while mature trees require direct sunlight. Beech tree is rarely seen in urban areas because it cannot grow in the atmosphere rich in carbon monoxide. People cultivate beech because of its ornamental morphology and high-quality wood that can be used for numerous purposes. Beeches are prone to fungal diseases that may induce rotting of the root and eventually death of the whole tree. Beeches are numerous and widely spread type of trees. They are not on the list of endangered species.</p>
