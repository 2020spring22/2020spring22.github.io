<h1> Twitch/Streaming Copyright Guidelines</h1>
<h2>Answers For The Great Hunt</h2>

  <p>Can you get DMCA'd On Twitch?</p>
<ul> 
  <li>Music companies have the right to DMCA takedown your content if they wish. Interscope seemingly did it by accident and went out of their way to retract their actions, meaning for Interscope at least, it's not a case of "we can't be bothered to take action against this", it's a case of "we're actually quite happy to have our music advertised on these streams so we won't be taking action".</li>

  </ul>

<p>How can you avoid a twitch-takedown</p>
<ul>
  <li>You can use copyright free music, made specifically for streamers. </li>
  
</ul>
  
<p>Do streaming platforms ban users for false takedowns?</p>
<ul>
  <li>No one seems to be immune to these copyright claims – Twitter had its own stream, which it had licensed the rights to, struck down by CBS for the first 10 minutes before it was restored. </li>
  </ul>
  <p>Is it okay to play music without commentary?</p>
  <ul>
<li>Not unless you want to get a DMCA takedown notice.</li>
  </ul>
  <p>What is the easiest way to avoid a VoD takedown </P>
<ul>
  <li>Always use copyright free music, or buy a track on websites like fiver. </li>
  
</ul>
