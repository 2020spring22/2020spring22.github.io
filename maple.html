      <p class="body">The maple tree is known for its striking fall color and distinctive leaves. And there are many maples, ranging from the small Tatarian maple (Acer tataricum) to the towering red maple (Acer rubrum), which can reach heights of 60 feet or more. Choose the best maple for your specific gardening needs.
      Maple trees are best suited to cooler climates and soils with good water retention. Maples don't generally do well in very dry or hot climates. Although specific needs vary among species, most maple trees thrive in deep, fertile soils that receive regular water from rain or an irrigation system. Because maple trees require regular, deep watering, do not plant them near other plants that are sensitive to wet conditions.</p>
