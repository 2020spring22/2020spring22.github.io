    <h2> Copyright? What's that?</h2>
    <p>"The exclusive legal right, given to an originator or an assignee to print, publish, perform, film, or record literary, artistic, or musical material, and to authorize others to do the same."</p>
    <h2>There is a lot of information surrounding copyright, here are some informative websites. </h2>

<h2>So What is Streaming Copyright?</h2>
<p>Just like using copyrighted music, broadcasting videogame content within a broadcast can also have legal implications for streamers. Many streamers, such as Twitch broadcasters, produce content based entirely on playing videogames. In these playthroughs, the underlying material is copyrighted and owned by the game developer, but streamers may be legally allowed to reproduce the copyrighted content if they fall under the “fair use” rule.</p>
<h3> This is a very confusing topic, as there is a lot of information out there.</h3>
