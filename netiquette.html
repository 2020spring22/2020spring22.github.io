		<h1> Email Netiquette</h1>
		<ol>
			<li> 1. Use email the way you want others to use it.</li>
			<ul>Remember that a human being (just like you) is at the other end reading your email, and don’t write anything you wouldn’t say face to face.</ul>
			<li> 2. Be careful when addressing email.</li>
			<ul> Know to whom you are sending, and be careful using CC’ed addresses.</ul>
			<li> 3. When in doubt, send plain text messages, not HTML.</li>
			<ul> Not everybody can receive your fancily formatted emails, and some may even react furiously due to the size and formatting of the message.</ul>
			<li>4. Know how large a message you are sending.</li>
			<ul> Including large files may make your message so big that it cannot be delivered. Consider file transfer or sharing as an alternative, or cutting the file into smaller chunks and sending each as a separate message.</ul>
			<li>5.  Be brief without being overly terse.</li>
			<ul> When replying to a message, include enough original material to be understood but no more. It is extremely bad form to simply reply to a message by including all the previous message: edit out all the irrelevant material.</ul>
			<li> 6. If you include a signature, keep it short.</li>
			<ul> Rule of thumb is 4 sentences or less, but in reality just make it one.</ul>

		<h2> Just be valid. </h2>
		<p> Validity is key to success. <span style="color:gold"> You </span> must always remember what former CIA chief General David Petraeus apparently forgot, warns Pachter: Every electronic message leaves a trail.

"A basic guideline is to assume that others will see what you write," she says, "so don't write anything you wouldn't want everyone to see." A more liberal interpretation: Don't write anything that would be ruinous to you or hurtful to others. After all, email is dangerously easy to forward, and it's better to be safe than sorry.</p>
		<p> Also please respond to your emails in <span style="font-family: Constantia, 'Lucida Bright', 'DejaVu Serif', Georgia, 'serif'">UNDER</span> 24 hours</p>
